PmodNIC100 Network Hardware Library

1.  To install this library refer to the instructions at ...\libraries\DNETcK\Readme.txt
2.  By default, the PmodNIC100 works with the following configurations.

        Uno32 with PmodShield and PmodNIC100 on connector JC
        Max32 with PmodShield and PmodNIC100 on connector JC
        MX3cK with PmodNIC100 on connector JE				
        MX4ck with PmodNIC100 on connector JB 				
        32MX4 with PmodNIC100 on connector JB 				
        MX7ck with PmodNIC100 on connector JF 				
        32MX7 with PmodNIC100 on connector JF 				

3.  Include in your sketch PmodNIC100.h before you include DNETcK.h. This network hardware library will not work with WiFi.
4.  Then build and run DNETcK as documented in ..\libraries\DNETcK\documents\DNETcK.pdf
5.  Also refer to the PmodNIC100 example sketches under ...\libraries\DNETcK\examples
